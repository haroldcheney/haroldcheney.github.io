An earlier version of this, arranged for strings, was performed in concert
on October 24, 2012, by the New Albany High School Concert Orchestra under
the direction of Julie Ellis.

This expanded version is arranged for a small wind band.

The audio file is performed by Finale, with a police whistle used instead of a
train whistle. Unfortunately, the police whistle sound effect doesn't sustain
the whole notes as they are written.
