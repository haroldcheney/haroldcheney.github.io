This started out as a string composition. The earlier version was performed in
concert on October 24, 2012, by the New Albany High School Concert Orchestra
under the direction of Julie Ellis.

This expanded version is arranged for a small wind band.

The audio file is performed by Finale, with a police whistle used instead of a
train whistle. Unfortunately, the police whistle sound effect doesn't sustain
the whole notes as they are written.
