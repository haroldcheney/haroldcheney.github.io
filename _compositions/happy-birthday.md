This is a two-part arrangement, but the lower part is out of range for flute
and trumpet. Clarinets and saxophones can reinforce the lower part as needed.
Alto and tenor sax parts are in unison, so if both are present, alto should play
upper and tenor should play lower. Percussion should be snare, but any instrument
can do in a pinch.

Audio is performed by Finale with flute, clarinet, and trumpet on upper part;
clarinet, bass clarinet and alto sax on lower part; and no tenor sax or trombone.
