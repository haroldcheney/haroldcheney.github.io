This is based on the SATB arrangement from the 1916 edition of
_Songs of Ohio State University_. I transposed from A flat to C and assigned
each part to appropriate instruments---so not really any new arranging here.

As much as possible, I gave all four parts to every instrument group, which gives
a lot of flexibility to shuffle parts around to get a balanced sound.

Audio is performed by Finale.

The "SAT" & "B" after the part names indicate which parts that are assigned to
that instrument.
