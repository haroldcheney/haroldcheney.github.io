This is my earliest composition that I would consider to be worthy of performance,
but I think the most interesting thing about it is the extent to which it was
shaped by non-musical considerations.

I bought my first copy of Finale sometime in the early 1990's. It was a considerable
investment for me at the time--maybe two weeks of wages, but it was a big step up
from Electronic Arts Deluxe Music Construction Set, especially in its ability to
create visually appealing scores.

I wanted to create a piece that would make the most of the new abilities. I chose
6/8 time in order to use a wider variety of note shapes. The ability to use double
sharps and flats was new to me. Double flats seemed visually boring, so I wanted
to use double sharps, which meant starting with a sharp enough key to reasonably
modulate using double sharps. I decided the name of the piece would include its
key, and aesthetically I preferred a simple unaltered letter, so B was as remote
as I could get, as opposed to F#. Finally, I wanted the piece to nicely fill one page,
which put significant constraints on its form.

All things considered, I'm fairly amazed at what I came up with, considering my
skills at the time.

Audio is performed by Finale.
