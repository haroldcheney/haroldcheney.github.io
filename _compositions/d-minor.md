This is my earliest composition that still exists in a usable form, dating to
sometime in the late 1980's. It was simply an exercise in the minor mode,
including the differences in the ascending and descending scales.

The fact that I made the effort to migrate this through the years whenever I
changed music software must mean that I saw something worthwhile in it.

I remember struggling to figure out what note to use for the right hand in the
third beat of measure 19. It finally occurred to me that it didn't need to be a
note---I could make it a rest. That was a lightbulb moment for me.

Audio is performed by Finale.
