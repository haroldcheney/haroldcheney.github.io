This is my earliest composition that I still have in usable digital form.

This was simply an experiment in using a minor key, including the differences in
the ascending and descending scales.

I have changed music software at least twice since then. The fact that I made the
effort to migrate it at least twice must mean I saw something worthwhile in it.

One thing I recall is struggling with what note to put in the right hand part
in the third beat of measure 19. It finally occurred to me that I could leave it
a rest. That was a lightbulb moment for me.

Audio is performed by Finale.
