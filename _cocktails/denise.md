When I first got the DeGroff's Pimento Aromatic Bitters, I wanted to try it in everyting.
Unfortunately, as is usually the case, I did not have everything in my bar. So I put the
DeGroff's in my pocket and went to my local bar. Fortunately, tending bar that night was Denise,
who is probably the most tolerant bartender I know. What I really wanted to try was Dale DeGroff's
Sazerac recipe, but this bar had no absinthe. I told Denise we could make do, kind of like when you
bake a cake, but don't have butter, so you use lard. I don't think she particularly appreciated the
association with lard, but like I said, she is very tolerant. So first we tried replacing the absinthe
with ouzo. It wasn't horrible, but not something I would try again.

Then we tried jagermeister, and it turned out suprisingly well. Definitely not a sazerac, but something
I would drink again. It needed a name, and I warned her that if she couldn't think of anything better,
it would be the "Denise".

First, rinse a chilled cocktail glass with jagermeister.

Then mix in a mixing glass:

* 1 part rye whiskey
* 1 part cognac
* a small amount of simple syrup
* a few dashes of DeGroff's bitters
* ice

Shake or stir and strain into the cocktail glass.
