Once I started experimenting with DeGroff's Pimento Aromatic Bitters, I wanted to try it in everything.
Unfortunately, I did not have everything in my liquor cabinet, so I put the DeGroff's in my pocket
and headed to my neighborhood pub, where the very tolerant Denice was tending bar.

What I really wanted to try was Dale DeGroff's Sazerac recipe, but Denice had no absinthe, so we tried
replacing it with ouzo. Not horrible, but not something I would try again. Then we tried Jägermeister,
and it turned out suprisingly well. Definitely not a Sazerac, but something I would drink again.

First, rinse a chilled cocktail glass with Jägermeister, discarding any excess.

Then in a mixing glass add:

* 1 part rye whiskey
* 1 part cognac
* a small amount of simple syrup
* a few dashes of DeGroff's bitters
* ice

Shake or stir and strain into the cocktail glass.
