Okay, this isn't a cocktail, but what should we do if Scotland secedes from the
United Kingdom?

Drink bourbon!

But what happens to the Union Jack? There seems to be a lot of hand wringing
about this, with the assumption being that the blue field should be removed,
because it comes from [St. Andrew's Cross][1]. However, the field isn't what
indicates the Saltire, it's the cross itself, which happens to be
[counterchanged][2] with [St. Patrick's][3].

Some [suggested modifications][4] remove the blue field, but retain the
counterchange, which doesn't make a lick of sense. To remove St. Andrew's cross,
all you need to do is remove the counterchange. The blue field can remain,
justified by Britannia's ruling of the waves.

This is not the current Union Jack, but most people would not see the
difference. As an added bonus, you can fly it upside down without upsetting
pedants.
