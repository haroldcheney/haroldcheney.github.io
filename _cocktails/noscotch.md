Okay, this isn't a cocktail, but what do you do if the Scots secede from the
United Kingdom?

Drink bourbon, duh!!!

But what happens to the Union Jack? There seems to be a lot of hand wringing
about this, with the assumption being that you would need to remove the blue
field. However, the blue field isn't what defines St. Andrew's cross, it isn't
even the right shade of blue! St. Andrew's cross on the Union Jack is defined
by its counterchange with St. Patrick's cross. So to remove St. Andrew's cross,
all you need to do is remove the counterchange. The blue field can remain,
justified by Britania's ruling of the waves.

This is not the current Union Jack, but most people would not see the difference.
