This is a wonderfully contemplative drink.

My wife brought back a bottle of Ricard Pastis from her trip to France, and I
wasn't sure what to do with it, so I searched online. The Asylum intrigued me.
The original recipe calls for Pernod, but I figured the pastis would work.

This is one of those cocktails that seems to have an unnecessarily complicated
preparation. The bottom line is that it's fun to watch the melding of the
ingredients, so do whatever you like---it will taste the same in the end.

These are the steps that work for me:

 * Rinse an old fashioned glass with water, to give the emulsifying a head start.
 * Pour enough grenadine to cover the bottom of the glass
 * Add a few ice cubes
 * Add one part pastis
 * Add one part gin
 * Watch and contemplate. I like to twist the glass a bit, but not stir.
 * Drink
