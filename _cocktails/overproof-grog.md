My taste in rums tends toward the dark side, so when I was gifted a bottle of
Wray & Nephew Overproof, I wasn't sure what to do with it. I figured it would
be like Bacardi 151, but when I tasted it, *wow*, this has some flavor!

The ratios below are what I settled on as best for me. You can adjust the ratio
of rum to water to taste, but don't completely eliminate the water. This is one
where water is needed to distribute the flavor.

  * 2 parts Wray & Nephew Overproof Rum
  * 1 part water
  * 1 part Cointreau
  * a few dashes of Scrappy's Lime Bitters
