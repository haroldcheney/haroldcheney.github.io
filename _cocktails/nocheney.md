Just say "No Cheney." Sweet, cinnamony, and smooth.

  *  3 parts bourbon
  *  1 part nocino
  *  a few dashes of Regans'
  *  cinnamon stick garnish

Serve on rocks.

If you strain the same ingredients into a cocktail glass, it's a Nocini.

I'm not a big fan of Watershed Bourbon straight---it's a bit too sweet for my
taste, but it complements the Watershed Nocino nicely.
