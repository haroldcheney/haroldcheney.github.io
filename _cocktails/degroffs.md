The DeGroff's Pimento Aromatic Bitters was an impulse purchase on Amazon. When I saw "pimento",
my first thought was those things they put in green olives, but that's "pimiento", which is not the
same thing. Apparently "pimento" is another name for allspice. When it arrived, I immediately loved
the smell. The first thing I tried was an Old Fashioned with Knob Creek Rye. Now, I'm not going to
tell you how to make an Old Fashioned. If you have not mastered that cocktail, start here:

I found that the DeGroff's works exceptionally well with Knob Creek Rye. If you normally make
your Old Fashioneds with ice, try this one without ice, to fully appreciate all the flavors.
